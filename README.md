# student-directory

Completed ahead of schedule, this task challenged me to not only make use of my newly acquired skills but also gave me the opportunity to further explore different approaches to problems and alternative methods (eg. inject).

The result of both independent work and collaboration, there are many elements to this project of which I am proud - eg. sorting by cohort, my decision to incorporate user feedback, ... - as well as areas upon which I can further improve.

I have thoroughly enjoyed building code to provide extended functionality both as suggested in the task itself and also from my own experience as a teacher - don't get me started about teacher requirements of a student directory!

I learned a lot about the importance of refactoring, particularly in reducing the code within a method and method names themselves, including, for instance, a method I defined print(students) which later caused issues when trying to use Ruby's own print method. Lesson learned!

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
