## My Approach ##

Completed ahead of schedule, this task challenged me to not only make use of my newly acquired skills but also gave me the opportunity to further explore different approaches to problems and alternative methods (eg. inject). It has also exposed me to the File class and the csv library.

The result of both independent work and collaboration, there are many elements to this project of which I am proud - eg. sorting by cohort, my decision to incorporate user feedback, learning about Ruby's CSV library - as well as areas upon which I can further improve - eg. refactoring, structuring my code logically and my knowledge of escape sequences.

## Takeaways ##

I have thoroughly enjoyed building code to provide extended functionality both as suggested in the task itself and also from my own experience as a teacher - don't get me started about teacher requirements of a student directory!

I learned a lot about the importance of refactoring, particularly in reducing the code within a method and method names themselves, including, for instance, a method I defined print(students) which later caused issues when trying to use Ruby's own print method. Lesson learned!

I also need to work on the way I build a project. Creating separate files of the same project is probably not the best way...!
